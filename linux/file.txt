Shell scripting is a powerful method for automating tasks in Unix and Linux environments. It involves writing a sequence of commands in a plain text file that the shell interpreter can execute. These scripts can simplify repetitive operations like file management, system monitoring, and software deployment. By using control structures such as loops and conditionals, shell scripts can make decisions and perform complex workflows. They also support variables, functions, and input/output redirection, allowing for modular and efficient code. Whether you're a system administrator, developer, or DevOps engineer, mastering shell scripting enhances productivity and gives you greater control over your system.
